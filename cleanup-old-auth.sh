echo "âœ… Removed Files:"
echo "  - src/middleware.ts (Kong handles route protection)"
echo "  - src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts (client-side logout)"
echo "  - fix-auth.sh (no longer needed)"
echo "  - test-auth.sh (replaced by setup-kong-jwt.sh)"
echo ""
echo "âœ… Simplified Files:"
echo "  - src/lib/jwt.ts (removed verification functions)"
echo "  - src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts (uses Kong JWT claims)"
echo "  - src/app/auth-provider.tsx (simplified auth check)"
echo "  - src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts (removed unnecessary headers)"

echo "ðŸ”§ Kong Now Handles:"
echo "  - JWT validation"
echo "  - Route protection"
echo "  - Token expiration"
echo "  - Rate limiting"
echo "  - CORS headers"
echo "  - Security headers"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“¦ Next.js App Now Only:"
echo "  - Generates JWT tokens on login"
echo "  - Reads JWT claims from Kong headers"
echo "  - Manages user sessions"
echo "  - Handles business logic"

echo "This results in:"
echo "  âœ… Cleaner codebase"
echo "  âœ… Better security (centralized at gateway)"
echo "  âœ… Better performance (JWT validation at edge)"
echo "  âœ… Easier maintenance"
echo "  âœ… Standard API gateway patterns"
